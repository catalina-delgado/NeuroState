# NeuroStage
"NeuroStage is a framework that allows users to create and manage deep learning projects in a structured and modular way, adapted for TensorFlow. It includes integration with tools like Tensorboard, enabling users to efficiently track and improve their models."

# Purpose
NeuroStage was born from the idea of automatically generating projects, with a specific focus on building deep learning models using TensorFlow. It is a tool designed for new users who need a standard structure without having to worry about organizing the project from scratch.

# Design
It is designed as a layer-based pattern (for building modules, architectures, and training) which is excellent for organizing a TensorFlow framework for deep learning testing. This modular approach facilitates integration with TensorBoard and promotes scalability. 

## Modules

**Layers** Define base layers here (e.g., convolutional, attention, etc.) that can be used in models. These layers form the building blocks for your deep learning models.

**Models** Combine the layers to create specific architectures for evaluation. This module allows you to design and implement various deep learning models by reusing and combining different layers.

**Training** Conduct experiments with specific configurations, logging metrics, parameters, and artifacts. This module focuses on the training process, helping you to configure and run training sessions, and track the performance and results.

## create a new layer
File: src/layers/layer_custom.py
```python
from imports import tf

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)

```
## create a new model
File: src/models/model_custom.py
```python
from imports import tf
from src.layers.layer_custom import CustomLayer

class ModelCustom():
    def __init__(self): 
        super(Model, self).__init__() 
        self.layer = CustomLayer(64)
        
        
    def build_model(self, input):
        x = self.layer(input)
        x = self.layer(x)
        x = self.layer(x)
        
        model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input, outputs=x)
